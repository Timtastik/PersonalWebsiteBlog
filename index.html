		<h4>Overall Fun</h4>

			<p>Laughter is the cure to any situation. Having the ability to laugh at your triumph or struggles gives others and yourself the expression that everything is alright. No matter what you do or where you are in life having fun is the key of enjoying life to its full potential. Though I may be serious about where it lies within my passion, I am a goof!</p>

		<h4>Fitness</h4>
		<img src="file:///C:/Users/timot/Documents/DBC_Code/DevBootCamp/PersonalWebsiteBlog/SittingFitness.jpg" alt="Tim sitting at the gym" width="300px" height="300px" />
			<p>Living a healthy lifestyle is the mediocre. Reaching your goals in fitness is achievement. I love having fitness being a part of my life, because there is no way cheating your way to greatness. You cannot do a dishonest work out and expect full load of results. It takes time, dedication, and mentality. </p>

		<img src="file:///C:/Users/timot/Documents/DBC_Code/DevBootCamp/PersonalWebsiteBlog/AirChairLetran.jpg" alt="Bboy at Letran" width="450px" height="300px" />
			<p>Dancing has been part of my life ever since I saw other people dancing. For as long as I remember I have been a dancer. I was not am not the best dancer I would like, but nevertheless I still love to move. Dancing is silent poetry with meaningful motion. The universal body language to express emotions!</p>

		<h4>All kinds of Music</h4>
		<img src="file:///C:/Users/timot/Documents/DBC_Code/DevBootCamp/PersonalWebsiteBlog/MonsterHeadphones.jpg" alt="Tim in Headphones" width="300px" height="400px" />
			<p>Music is the wavelengths of vibrancy to enhance one's feelings and understand those feelings in whole. A new hot song is uplifting to the hype! As long as a song gets one to feel or enhance your mood then the song has done its job.</p>

		<h4>Spoken Word Poetry</h4>
		<img src="file:///C:/Users/timot/Documents/DBC_Code/DevBootCamp/PersonalWebsiteBlog/Word.jpg" alt="Friend's Computer Shop" width="500px" height="350px" />
			<p>Expression through communication using the right elegance of words brings out the inner soul and connect it to reality. Poetry is the foundation of communicating to others in a beautiful way.</p>

		<h3>Web Site Comparison!</h3>

		<p>http://earmilk.com/</p>
		<p>I like how the earmilk site has a top part for navigation that stays at the top of the browser when a user is scrolling through the page! There is also layouts where you can see content utilizing most of the space for the site rather than having spaced out like my website. There are sections on the left and right where people are not confused at the content they are seeing. Earmilk looks more of a lively site especially with the acivity/interaction that is going on! My site has content, but it not appealing at all.</p>
